# Python 3.11 is recommended.

# PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 (Example - adjust to your system or use CPU version)
# For CPU-only PyTorch, remove the --extra-index-url and specify torch cpu versions
# or let pip resolve. For specific CUDA, this index is helpful.
# Ensure your PyTorch version matches your system's CUDA capabilities if using GPU.
# If no GPU or unsure, you can install the CPU version:
# torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
